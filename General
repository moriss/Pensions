Pensions Explained

It's a pot of cash that you, and/or your employer, can pay into – and which you get tax relief on (a way of saving up for your retirement).

Then, at retirement, you can draw money from your pension pot or exchange the cash with an insurance company for a regular income until death, called an annuity.

Tax Relief
You get 20% tax back from the Government as an additional deposit into your pension pot.
I think this means that when you pay £100 into your pension in a year, the governments contributes 20% (£20) as a further deposit.

With pensions, other than workplace pensions, this relief needs to be claimed, or you don't get it. It's not automatic



How much can I put in a pension?
There's technically no limit as to how much you can put in a pension – but there are limits on how much tax relief you'll get for doing so. There are three different limits to be aware of:

An earnings limit
You get tax relief on contributions up to your annual earnings. Imagine you earned £20,000 each year, but had £30,000 in savings, and decided one day to put all your savings into a pension. Because your earnings are only £20,000, you would only earn tax relief on the first £20,000 of your contributions.
